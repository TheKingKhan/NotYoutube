Project I'm doing for a class that is video uploading and sharing social network, I think

Must Do:
- Login Front End
- Backend Authentication
- Backend Session Management
- Home/Profile Front End
- Search User Front End
- Serve Video Front End
- Serve Video Back End
- Upload Video Backend
- Delete Video Backend
- Serve Linked Video Backend
- SQL Injection (probably gonna be user database related)
- Server Side Request Forgery (something doesn't come to mind immiediately )
- Command Injection (Use someone accessing your profiles cookie to upload to their page?)
- Hope that Hao actually looks at this and responds to my message


Could Do:
- Make it pretty
- Comments
- Like/Dislike
- Drop out and move to Mexico and become a dive instructor
